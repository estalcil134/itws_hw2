I was in charge of creating the sliders. I first made the sliders in HTML and customized them, fitting them within our bounds and making them more aesthetically pleasing. 
Next, I assigned values to the sliders (0-255), and dynamically drew the values from them to get the hexadecimal values (which I also wrote a simple function for). I strung together the RGB values from the sliders to get the hexadecimal color value, and displayed that as well. At the same time, I updated the color in real time as the sliders were dragged.

Using a jQuery plugin is preferable over using JavaScript that uses jQuery because it ensure that "this" is a jQuery object, as a non-jQuery object will throw an error.
