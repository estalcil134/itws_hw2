This was a very interesting project to work on and I learned a lot from it.


1) What are the advantages to writing a jQuery plugin over regular JavaScript that uses jQuery?
Writing a jQuery plugin instead of regular JavaScript that uses jQuery is the efficiency that it produces.
It will allow us to call the plugin once and it will incorporate every function that is needed inside the function. The usability and time
it saves is greatly different from vanilla JS with some jQuery. In addition, jQuery adds some major improvements to JS code which allows
the plugin to thrive in this format.

2) Explain how your jQuery plugin adheres to best practices in JavaScript and jQuery development.
It adheres to the best practices in JavaScript and jQuery development by using the modern and up to date code format that ensures
the availability of new code to be put into the plugin with no changes. Using the lessons that we have learned in this course, we have
implemented the best practices to the code that were available for this homework.

3) Does anything prevent you from POSTing high scores to a server on a different domain? If so, what? If
not, how would we go about it (written explanation/pseudocode is fine here)?
POSTing high scores to a server on a different domain would not be in line with the SOP (Same Origin Policy). The SOP is an important concept in regards to web security. Under the policy, a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin. This would not work with POSTing scores to a different server on a different domain because it would not help with the web security and might allow attackers to get private
information from the server.
